I work in explainable AI (xAI) and unconventional approaches to AI. I work at the intersection of complex systems and xAI: I take inspiration from complex systems to suggest new approaches to AI, and use AI to analyze complex systems.


## Projects 

### Foundation models for artificial life


Foundation models for artificial life.

Automating the Search for Artificial Life with Foundation Models

### Multi-agent systems for automated science

Building multi-agent systems and generative AI systems for automated science. 

We will also look at applying these frameworks to other sectors (such as finance, economics, defence, environment, policy, etc.)

Look at:

https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7309730788286124032/

### Reasoning and large language models project 1

Build LLMs to work on SimpleBench

https://simple-bench.com/



### Project idea (Reasoning and large language models)
 
 Build a large language model to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge
 
   https://github.com/fchollet/ARC

 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge

   https://blog.jovian.ai/finishing-2nd-in-kaggles-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge-24e59c07b50a

   https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle

It has been suggested that large language models cannot reason. This project will infuse some reasoning/priors into large language models and apply them to a large reasoning corpus (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus). 

We can also apply large language models to reasoning in math problems.

This will be a collaboration with Mikel Bober-Irizar.


### Project idea (Explainable AI)

* Contemporary approaches towards explainable AI are model-centric. We will use data-centric approaches to explain the complex interplay between data and models. This will build on and extend published work [1]. This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience. 
 
 There are many ways in which the work presented in [1] can be extended (either new methods or new application areas). Please get in touch to discuss. 
 


### Project idea: Personalized explainable AI

Tailor machine learning model explanations based on audience (e.g. patients, clinicians, farmers, etc.). Generate natural language explanations from machine learning model and tailor these natural language explanations based on the unique background of the listener/audience.


### Project: Tradeoffs between explainabilty and privacy

Develop explainable machine learning models that explain themselves but do so without leaking personal data. For example, class-contrastive reasoning techniques [1] can be used to generate explanations. But they can inadvertently leak personal data. This project will explore the tradeoff between explainability and privacy (and potentially bias). This will lead to models that balance explainability, privacy and bias.

### Project idea: Explainable privacy preserving machine learning

Develop explainable machine learning models that are also privacy preserving. 

Model explanations will be extracted from machine learning models. However this can lead to leakage of private data. Hence one approach is to add noise to model weights (using differential privacy techniques). This will lead to explainable models that are also privacy preserving.

This can also be done in a federated fashion that will help preserve privacy. 




### Project idea: Generative AI applied to complex systems


This project will involve modelling complex systems (like an epidemic spread) with generative agents. For example, generative agents can be coupled to agent based models. This can be used to simulate epidemics.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04986

https://github.com/bear96/GABM-Epidemic

We will further develop this this framework and apply it to other complex systems (like supply chains, modelling of disinformation, people who are against taking vaccines, conflicts in societies, ecosystem modelling [see below] etc.) 

https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/home/model-components/

We can also apply this to models like the World3 model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3

https://github.com/cvanwynsberghe/pyworld3

and models of ecosystems

https://gitlab.com/ecotwin/


### Project idea (Explainable neural cellular automata applied to biology [computational biology project])

Extending the neural cellular automata

https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/#experiment-2

and make it more interpretable and explainable.

For example, you can apply it to data from the Game of Life and infer the rules.

https://github.com/lantunes/netomaton/blob/master/demos/game_of_life/README.md

https://github.com/tomgrek/gameoflife

We can also apply it to biological data from cell biology (this can be a computational biology project). We have real world data from cell biology. 

https://greydanus.github.io/2022/05/24/studying-growth/

No experience in biology is required.


### Project idea
 
 * Build a computational model of analogy making and apply it to biomedical and genomic data.
 
 For other project ideas related to explainable AI see the following page:
 
 https://github.com/neelsoumya/special_topics_unconventional_AI/
 
 Broadly this will use concepts like analogies and stories to create new explainable AI methods.
 
 See for example 
 
 https://github.com/Tijl/ANASIME
 
 https://github.com/crazydonkey200/SMEPy

 https://github.com/fargonauts/copycat
 

 
 

### Project idea (Automated Scientific Discovery)
  
This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws (like Kepler's Law) and invariants (like Boyle's Law) from data.  

This may involve building a model or Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of infection dynamics (like a SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5]. This would apply a probabilistic programming model to infection data from different sources.  

Other models include phsyics simulators like pymunk:

http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/examples.html#planet-py

You would simulate physics based simulations (like pymunk) or other models (like the SIR model above) and develop a machine learning approach to automatically generate insights from this model.

This would be an explainable AI model for a complex model of a physical system.

The project would involve building a model that would generate insights from these complex systems (an artificial model of human creativity).



### Project idea (Automated Scientific Discovery)

### Project idea (Automated Scientific Discovery applied to different problems [e.g. healthcare])

This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws or mathematical equations from data.    

This would involve extending the Ramanujan machine by applying it to other data or other dynamical systems or using another machine learning approach.

https://github.com/RamanujanMachine/RamanujanMachine

Other ideas including extending AI Feynman 2.0 

https://github.com/SJ001/AI-Feynman

or BACON.3

https://github.com/jantzen/BACON

One can also apply symbolic regression approaches like PySR (python) or gramEvol (R).

This can be applied to discover, for example, trigonometric identities.

<!-- one can also apply Bayesian symbolic regression. This can be applied to discover trigonometric identities. This would be a joint project with Challenger Mishra -->

<!-- data can be used from the AI feynman database on Max tegmark's website -->

Other approaches include Bayesian symbolic regression 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08892

https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg


or seq2seq approaches to symbolic regression

https://openreview.net/pdf?id=W7jCKuyPn1

https://github.com/SymposiumOrganization/NeuralSymbolicRegressionThatScales

This would be an artificial model of human creativity.

Other ideas include discovering ordinary differential equations from data

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02830#



### Project idea (Collective intelligence in AI)

Dynamics of collective learning in artificial neural networks, Hopfield networks, self organizing maps and neural gas.


### Project idea (Collective intelligence in AI)
 
This project will investigate collective artifical intelligence in building behaviour (altruism, co-operation, competition) and structures (structures to capture prey). This will use the multi-agent platform MAgent

https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent

We can also use the EvoJax framework

https://github.com/google/evojax/blob/main/examples/notebooks/EncirclingAgents.ipynb

We can also extend MAgent using dream mechanisms in World Models

https://worldmodels.github.io/

<!-- morphology or wave propagation in the Rho GTPase system -->
<!--This would be similar to wave propagation in B-Z systems. We can also apply it to data from the B-Z system. -->

<!-- we can also apply it to data from computational fluid dynamics -->

Another idea is to apply this to simulations from computational fluid dynamics using the software below:

https://github.com/md861/HypFEM

This would be jointly with Mayank Drolia.

This can also be applied to genomic data.

### Multi-agent collaboration with LLMs

Creating multi-agent systems with LLMs. 

``In many companies, managers routinely decide what roles to hire, and then how to split complex projects â€” like writing a large piece of software or preparing a research report â€” into smaller tasks to assign to employees with different specialties. Using multiple agents is analogous. Each agent implements its own workflow, has its own memory (itself a rapidly evolving area in agentic technology: how can an agent remember enough of its past interactions to perform better on upcoming ones?), and may ask other agents for help. Agents can also engage in Planning and Tool Use. This results in a cacophony of LLM calls and message passing between agents that can result in very complex workflows.``
