## About the Project

Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in healthcare, yet many state-of-the-art machine learning systems remain difficult to interpret, limiting their adoption in clinical practice. Developing explainable AI (XAI) methods that provide transparent, reliable, and clinically meaningful insights is therefore a major research challenge. At the same time, large-scale healthcare datasets generated within the UK’s health system, including those associated with the National Health Service, offer unprecedented opportunities to study disease risk, treatment outcomes, and population health.

This PhD project will focus on developing and applying novel explainable artificial intelligence algorithms to healthcare datasets relevant to clinical decision-making and public health. The aim is to design models that not only achieve strong predictive performance but also provide interpretable insights that clinicians, policymakers, and patients can trust.

The project will investigate new approaches to explainability in machine learning, including interpretable deep learning architectures, causal inference methods, symbolic or hybrid AI approaches, and novel techniques for understanding model reasoning. These methods will be evaluated on real-world healthcare data, with applications that may include risk prediction, disease progression modelling, health system optimisation, and early detection of complex conditions.

A key objective is to bridge the gap between advanced AI systems and real-world healthcare deployment. The student will explore how explainable models can improve transparency, fairness, and accountability in clinical AI systems. The research may also examine broader questions such as how clinicians interpret model explanations, how explainability affects trust in AI-assisted decision-making, and how AI systems can be safely integrated into healthcare workflows.

Depending on the student’s interests and background, the project may involve:

* Developing new explainable AI algorithms
* Applying machine learning to NHS-scale healthcare datasets
* Analysing model interpretability, robustness, and fairness
* Studying reasoning and abstraction in AI systems
* Building tools for clinical decision support
* Combining statistical modelling, deep learning, and complex systems analysis

The student will work in an interdisciplinary research environment combining artificial intelligence, healthcare analytics, and computational science. There will be opportunities to collaborate with researchers across AI, data science, and healthcare-related disciplines.

This PhD will provide training in advanced machine learning, explainable AI, healthcare data analysis, and responsible AI development. The research aims to contribute to the next generation of transparent AI systems that can be safely used in healthcare and other high-stakes domains.

## Candidate Background

We are looking for motivated students interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and healthcare applications.

Applicants may come from backgrounds such as:

* Computer Science
* Artificial Intelligence
* Mathematics or Statistics
* Physics or Engineering
* Computational Biology / Bioinformatics
* Data Science

Experience in Python, machine learning, or data analysis is helpful but not required. Curiosity, creativity, and an interest in interdisciplinary research are particularly important.

---

## Eligibility

Applicants should have, or expect to achieve, at least a **2:1 honours degree or a master’s degree (or international equivalent)** in a relevant subject such as computer science, mathematics, engineering, or a related discipline.

---

## Funding

This is a **self-funded PhD project**.

Applicants are encouraged to apply if they already hold funding or intend to apply for external scholarships. The supervisor will support strong candidates in identifying and applying for funding opportunities, which may include international scholarships, government-sponsored studentships, or competitive university awards.

---

## Before you apply

Prospective applicants are strongly encouraged to contact **Dr [Your Name]** before applying. Please include:

* A short description of your academic background
* A CV
* A paragraph explaining your interest in the project
* Any previous research or project experience

This helps us determine whether the project is a good fit for your interests and background.

---

## How to apply

Applications should be submitted through the university’s PhD application portal.

When applying, please include:

* CV
* Academic transcripts
* A brief research statement or personal statement
* Contact details for two referees
* Evidence of English language proficiency (if required)

Further instructions will be provided after an initial discussion with the supervisor.

## Equality, Diversity and Inclusion

We strongly encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds and career paths. Diversity strengthens research communities and helps generate new ideas and perspectives in artificial intelligence and healthcare research.

Flexible study options, including part-time study arrangements, may be possible depending on university policies.

---

## Funding Notes

This is a **self-funded project**, but the supervisor will support strong candidates in identifying suitable scholarship opportunities and funding routes.

Early applications are recommended.

---

## Optional (This Improves Applications on FindAPhD)

You may want to add a short **research group description**, for example:

The project will be conducted within a research group working on artificial intelligence, complex systems, and responsible AI. Current research includes abstraction and reasoning in machine learning systems, AI safety, explainability, and the societal impacts of advanced AI.

---

## If you want, I can also help you create:

* **2–3 additional FindAPhD listings** that attract different types of students, for example:

1. AI Safety and Human-System Risk
2. Large Language Models and Reasoning
3. Complex Systems and Emergent Intelligence
4. AI for Scientific Discovery

Posting **multiple targeted listings** usually dramatically increases applicant quality.
