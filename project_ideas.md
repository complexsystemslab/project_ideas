## Projects 

### Project idea 1

* Contemporary approaches towards explainable AI are model-centric. We will use data-centric approaches to explain the complex interplay between data and models. This will build on and extend published work [1]. This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience. 
 
 There are many ways in which the work presented in [1] can be extended (either new methods or new application areas). Please get in touch to discuss. 

  This work is part of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery which aims to democratize access to AI tools and apply AI to problems from diverse disciplines. The student will be part of a growing community of inter-disciplinary AI researchers at the University of Cambridge. 


### Project idea 2

* For high stakes decisions we need simple and explainable/interpretable models. This need is acute in the case of healthcare and social sciences like recidivism prediction [2]. In this project, we will build simple interpretable models that are surrogates for deep learning models. 

  The student will look at publicly available data and synthetic data to generate surrogate models that are transparent and interpretable. The process of creating these surrogate interpretable models will be automated. This can also be partially based on published work [1]. 

 The surrogate models can be decision trees (like CART) trained on the input and output of a deep learning model [1].   This can use R packages like party, rpart, partykit or other packages. 
 This will lead to tools that automated the creation of surrogate interpretable models based on deep learning models in healthcare. 

  This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding
  experience.

### Project idea 3

* Other project ideas are generating synthetic data from private datasets like data from electronic healthcare records data [3], other explanatory artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques, privacy preserving machine learning [4], documenting data and models, detecting concept drift, etc. 

 Project ideas can be developed according to student interests. 
 
 ### Project idea 4
 
 For other project ideas related to explainable AI see the following page:
 
 https://github.com/neelsoumya/special_topics_unconventional_AI/
 
 Broadly this will use concepts like analogies and stories to create new explainable AI methods.
 
 See for example 
 
 https://github.com/Tijl/ANASIME
 
 https://github.com/crazydonkey200/SMEPy

 https://github.com/fargonauts/copycat
 
 
 ### Project idea 5
 
 Build a machine learning algorithm or domain specific language to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge
 
   https://github.com/fchollet/ARC

 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge

   https://blog.jovian.ai/finishing-2nd-in-kaggles-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge-24e59c07b50a

   https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle

 Domain specific languages may be required (as suggested by Chollet) like genetic algorithms and cellular automata
 
 Please note this is a very challenging project.
 
 
### Project idea 6

Tailor machine learning model explanations based on audience (e.g. patients, clinicians, farmers, etc.). Generate natural language explanations from machine learning model and tailor these natural language expplnanations based on unique background of listener (joint supervision with Peter Ochieng). 

### Project idea 7
  
Building a Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of infection dynamics (like a SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5].  

### Project idea 8

Dynamics of learning in artificial neural networks, Hopfield networks, self organizing maps and neural gas.
 
 
## Supervision 
 
 Students will be jointly supervised with Prof. Neil Lawrence.

## Bigger Picture

The main objective is to develop a suite of techniques inspired by classical AI to inform explainable AI.
This project is part of a wider effort of unconventional approaches to AI.
