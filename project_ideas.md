## Projects 

### Project idea 1

* Contemporary approaches towards explainable AI are model-centric. We will use data-centric approaches to explain the complex interplay between data and models. This will build on published work [1]. This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience. 
 

  This work is part of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery which aims to democratize access to AI tools and apply AI to problems from diverse disciplines. The student will be part of a growing community of inter-disciplinary AI researchers at the University of Cambridge. 


### Project idea 2

* For high stakes decisions we need simple and explainable/interpretable models. This need is acute in the case of healthcare and social sciences like recidivism prediction [2]. In this project, we will build simple interpretable models that are surrogates for deep learning models. 

  The student will look at publicly available data and synthetic data to generate surrogate models that are transparent and interpretable. The process of creating these surrogate interpretable models will be automated. This can also be partially based on published work [1]. 

 The surrogate models can be decision trees (like CART) trained on the input and output of a deep learning model [1].   This can use R packages like party, rpart, partykit or other packages. 
 This will lead to tools that automated the creation of surrogate interpretable models based on deep learning models in healthcare. 

  This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding
  experience.

### Project idea 3

* Other project ideas are generating synthetic data from private datasets like data from electronic healthcare records data [3], other explanatory artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques, privacy preserving machine learning [4], documenting data and models, detecting concept drift, etc. 

 Project ideas can be developed according to student interests. Students will be jointly supervised with Prof. Neil Lawrence.
