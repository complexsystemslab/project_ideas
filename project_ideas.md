### Agentic AI for Enterprise Data Management (working with VULQAN.ai)

Work with VULQAN.ai (https://www.vulqan.ai), an NYC-based AI startup, on building agentic AI systems that transform fragmented enterprise data models into unified ontologies or "Logical Data Models". The project builds on prior Cambridge research reframing Text-to-SQL as a knowledge representation problem, showing that semantic abstraction layers significantly boost LLM accuracy on messy, real-world enterprise schemas. Students will work with team members on a multi-agent framework for abstracting objects, deduping variables, inferring relationships, normalizing lists, and aligning data structures to a consistent semantic layer that can be reasoned over by LLMs. The system will be benchmarked on live use cases from global enterprises.

Consider this project if you are interested in applied AI, LLMs, knowledge graphs, and enterprise data engineering, and want hands-on experience with a fast-growth AI startup. 

Your research will be co-supervised by Sara Mani Kapoor (VULQAN.ai), with opportunities for publication and for conversion to an internship or full time position at VULQAN.ai after dissertation submission.


## Multi-agent generative systems

Some projects with https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi


### Multi-modal LLMs for life sciences



### Foundation models and chatbots for mental health



PROJECT1 

Recovery from mental health conditions comes in different shapes and sizes; spanning over months or even decades. However, due to long waiting times and increasing workloads, such continuous care is often unattainable within traditional healthcare systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries where resources are limited and stigma remains high. Recent advancements in generative AI have shown significant promise in addressing these gaps by offering scalable, personalized, and empathetic support tools. These technologies have been successfully applied to mental health care through therapeutic chatbots, psychoeducational tools, and emotional support systems. 

Building on these developments, we propose a multi-agent generative AI system to offer recovery stories to the readers which could help individuals feel supported and empathized. Our system would have three core components: (1) a research-focused agent that analyses user input and recommends publicly available stories—both fictional and non-fictional—that resonate with the user’s query; (2) a content critic agent that ensures the recommended material is filtered for harmful or triggering elements and gives a warning if something like this is  present; and (3) a presentation agent that delivers the stories in a safe and emotionally sensitive manner. This system aims to provide users with relatable, hopeful narratives that support their recovery journey while maintaining safety and ethical integrity. At the conclusion of the project, there is possibility of hosting a workshop involving individuals with lived experience of mental illness to gather feedback and explore future directions for co-designed storytelling tools.  


PROJECT2 

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, and more specifically in generative AI, have demonstrated significant potential in providing scalable, personalized, and empathetic support tools. These technologies have been effectively applied to mental health care through therapeutic chatbots, psychoeducational platforms, and emotionally intelligent systems that foster resilience and self-awareness. Building on these developments, we propose a conversational AI companion powered by multi-agent LLM architecture, including a semantic reasoning agent, a content-alignment module, and a generative engine. The goal is not to diagnose or treat, but to empower individuals with a digital partner that encourages purposeful living. 

Project in collaboration with Shrankhla Pandey.

   https://blog.jovian.ai/finishing-2nd-in-kaggles-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge-24e59c07b50a

   https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle

It has been suggested that large language models cannot reason. This project will infuse some reasoning/priors into large language models and apply them to a large reasoning corpus (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus).

### Project idea 1 (Explainable AI)

* Contemporary approaches towards explainable AI are model-centric. We will use data-centric approaches to explain the complex interplay between data and models. This will build on and extend published work [1]. This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience. 
 
 There are many ways in which the work presented in [1] can be extended (either new methods or new application areas). Please get in touch to discuss. 
 
 
### Project idea 1B: explainable AI applied to biology/computational biology

 Another project idea is to apply explainable AI approaches to genomic data. This will be a machine learning, computational biology and bioinformatics project.
 
 The student will develop explainable AI approaches for interpreting clusters in single-cell gene expression data or other biological data. There is an opportunity to also look at other computational biology projects. No background is biology is necessary.


  This work is part of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery which aims to democratize access to AI tools and apply AI to problems from diverse disciplines. The student will be part of a growing community of inter-disciplinary AI researchers at the University of Cambridge. 

<!--
### Project idea 1C: explainable AI applied to biology/computational biology

Cells express receptors on their surface. These receptors are expressed based on genes.
These receptors bind to rceptors on other cells.

This project will use publicly available genomic data to predict what receptors will be expressed on the surface of a cell.
-->

### Project idea 1C: explainable AI and LLMs/generative AI applied to health data/electronic healthcare record data

This project will involve developing novel explainable AI algorithms, LLMs and generative AI and applying them to health data from a local hospital. The data will be on mental health.

The student will work closely with a clinician and psychiatrist and work on real data. The student will learn skills on how to work in an inter-disciplinary manner. This work would have real work impact and will help patients with mental illnesses.

This is work in collaboration with a clinician.


<!--
### Project idea 2

* For high stakes decisions we need simple and explainable/interpretable models. This need is acute in the case of healthcare and social sciences like recidivism prediction [2]. In this project, we will build simple interpretable models that are surrogates for deep learning models. 

  The student will look at publicly available data and synthetic data to generate surrogate models that are transparent and interpretable. The process of creating these surrogate interpretable models will be automated. This can also be partially based on published work [1]. 

 The surrogate models can be decision trees (like CART) trained on the input and output of a deep learning model [1].   This can use R packages like party, rpart, partykit or other packages. 
 This will lead to tools that automated the creation of surrogate interpretable models based on deep learning models in healthcare. 

  This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience.
  

   This work is part of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery which aims to democratize access to AI tools  and apply AI to problems from diverse disciplines. The student will be part of a growing community of inter-disciplinary AI researchers.

### Project idea 1D: Personalized explainable AI

Tailor machine learning model explanations based on audience (e.g. patients, clinicians, farmers, etc.). Generate natural language explanations from machine learning model and tailor these natural language explanations based on the unique background of the listener/audience.


### Project 2: Tradeoffs between explainabilty and privacy

Develop explainable machine learning models that explain themselves but do so without leaking personal data. For example, class-contrastive reasoning techniques [1] can be used to generate explanations. But they can inadvertently leak personal data. This project will explore the tradeoff between explainability and privacy (and potentially bias). This will lead to models that balance explainability, privacy and bias.

<!--
### Project idea 4B: Explainable privacy preserving machine learning

Develop explainable machine learning models that are also privacy preserving. 

Model explanations will be extracted from machine learning models. However this can lead to leakage of private data. Hence one approach is to add noise to model weights (using differential privacy techniques). This will lead to explainable models that are also privacy preserving.

This can also be done in a federated fashion that will help preserve privacy. 

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Abhirup Ghosh.

<!---### Project idea 5: Explainable AI models applied to time series data

This project is a collaboration with Dr. Abhirup Ghosh.
-->


### Project idea 3: Generative AI applied to complex systems


This project will involve modelling complex systems (like an epidemic spread) with generative agents. For example, generative agents can be coupled to agent based models. This can be used to simulate epidemics.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04986

https://github.com/bear96/GABM-Epidemic

We will further develop this this framework and apply it to other complex systems (like supply chains, modelling of disinformation, people who are against taking vaccines, conflicts in societies, ecosystem modelling [see below] etc.) 

https://research.csiro.au/atlantis/home/model-components/

We can also apply this to models like the World3 model

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3

https://github.com/cvanwynsberghe/pyworld3

and models of ecosystems

### Project idea 5 (Automated Scientific Discovery)
  
This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws (like Kepler's Law) and invariants (like Boyle's Law) from data.  

This may involve building a model or Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of infection dynamics (like a SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5]. This would apply a probabilistic programming model to infection data from different sources.  

Other models include phsyics simulators like pymunk:

http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/examples.html#planet-py

You would simulate physics based simulations (like pymunk) or other models (like the SIR model above) and develop a machine learning approach to automatically generate insights from this model.

This would be an explainable AI model for a complex model of a physical system.

The project would involve building a model that would generate insights from these complex systems (an artificial model of human creativity).

This project will use large-language models.

For example, LLMs can be used to generate hypotheses or a concept library:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09359

Other ideas include modelling all the steps of scientific disovery (ideation, hypothesis formation, etc) using agentic LLMs:

https://allenai.github.io/discoveryworld/


### Project idea 5B (Automated Scientific Discovery)
  
This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws (like Kepler's Law) and invariants (like Boyle's Law) from data.  This will enable us to automatically discover conservation laws from data.

One can build a model or Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of a complex systems model like infection dynamics (SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5]. 

This would involve building a qualitative process model for a physical system.   

This would be an explainable AI model for a complex model of a physical system.

The project would involve building a model that would generate insights from these complex systems (an artificial model of human creativity).


### Project idea 5C (Automated Scientific Discovery applied to different problems [e.g. healthcare])

This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws or mathematical equations from data.    

This would involve extending the Ramanujan machine by applying it to other data or other dynamical systems or using another machine learning approach.

https://github.com/RamanujanMachine/RamanujanMachine

Other ideas including extending AI Feynman 2.0 

https://github.com/SJ001/AI-Feynman

or BACON.3

https://github.com/jantzen/BACON

One can also apply symbolic regression approaches like PySR (python) or gramEvol (R).

This can be applied to discover, for example, trigonometric identities.

<!-- one can also apply Bayesian symbolic regression. This can be applied to discover trigonometric identities. This would be a joint project with Challenger Mishra -->

<!-- data can be used from the AI feynman database on Max tegmark's website -->

Other approaches include Bayesian symbolic regression 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08892

https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg


or seq2seq approaches to symbolic regression

https://openreview.net/pdf?id=W7jCKuyPn1

https://github.com/SymposiumOrganization/NeuralSymbolicRegressionThatScales

This would be an artificial model of human creativity.

Other ideas include discovering ordinary differential equations from data

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02830#


<!--
These techniques can also be applied to healthcare data (for example, data from smartwatches). This would be an AI applied to healthcare project (jointly with Dr. Abhirup Ghosh). 

An example dataset can be the following:

-->

### Project idea (Collective intelligence in AI)

Dynamics of collective learning in artificial neural networks, Hopfield networks, self organizing maps and neural gas.

Application of ideas of emergence of intelligence-like behaviour in these systems like the following paper

Evolving reservoir computers reveals bidirectional coupling between predictive power and emergent dynamics

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19201v1

 
### Project idea 6 (Collective intelligence in AI)
 
This project will investigate collective artifical intelligence in building behaviour (altruism, co-operation, competition) and structures (structures to capture prey). This will use the multi-agent platform MAgent

https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent

We can also use the EvoJax framework

https://github.com/google/evojax/blob/main/examples/notebooks/EncirclingAgents.ipynb

We can also extend MAgent using dream mechanisms in World Models

https://worldmodels.github.io/

https://smartlabai.medium.com/world-models-a-reinforcement-learning-story-cdcc86093c5


### Project idea 6C (Modelling complex systems with generative agents)

This project will involve modelling complex systems (like an epidemic spread) with generative agents. For example, generative agents can be coupled to agent based models. This can be used to simulate epidemics.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04986

https://github.com/bear96/GABM-Epidemic

We will further develop this this framework and apply it to other complex systems (like supply chains, modelling of disinformation, people who are against taking vaccines, conflicts in societies, ecosystem modelling [see below] etc.)

We can also apply it to biological data from cell biology (this can be a computational biology project). We have real world data from cell biology. 

https://greydanus.github.io/2022/05/24/studying-growth/

<!-- morphology or wave propagation in the Rho GTPase system -->
<!--This would be similar to wave propagation in B-Z systems. We can also apply it to data from the B-Z system. -->

<!-- we can also apply it to data from computational fluid dynamics -->

Another idea is to apply this to simulations from computational fluid dynamics using the software below:

https://github.com/md861/HypFEM

This would be jointly with Mayank Drolia.

This can also be applied to genomic data.

### Project idea 8 (Commonsense reasoning in large language models)

This project would involve injecting commonsense in large language models.

Large language models can fail in spectacular ways. Some of this can be attributed to a lack of commonsense:

http://web.archive.org/web/20230902080842/https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/doug-lenat-1950-2023

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04445.pdf

This would involve using the open-source database of commonsense rules (OpenCyc)

https://github.com/asanchez75/opencyc

and incorporating small aspects of this in a simple large language model.



### Project idea 9 (Reasoning and large language models)
 
 Build a large language model to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge
 
   https://github.com/fchollet/ARC

 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge

   https://blog.jovian.ai/finishing-2nd-in-kaggles-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge-24e59c07b50a

   https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle

It has been suggested that large language models cannot reason. This project will infuse some reasoning/priors into large language models and apply them to a large reasoning corpus (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus). 

We will also augment human performance with LLMs (by using a recent database of how humans solve ARC problems).

We can also apply large language models to reasoning in math problems.

This will be a collaboration with Mikel Bober-Irizar and Kiril Bikov.

### Multi-agent collaboration with LLMs

Creating multi-agent systems with LLMs. 

``In many companies, managers routinely decide what roles to hire, and then how to split complex projects — like writing a large piece of software or preparing a research report — into smaller tasks to assign to employees with different specialties. Using multiple agents is analogous. Each agent implements its own workflow, has its own memory (itself a rapidly evolving area in agentic technology: how can an agent remember enough of its past interactions to perform better on upcoming ones?), and may ask other agents for help. Agents can also engage in Planning and Tool Use. This results in a cacophony of LLM calls and message passing between agents that can result in very complex workflows.``

Negative selection algorithms are inspired by how the immune system is trained to detect pathogens. This project will involve developing a biologically inspired machine learning algorithm and applying it to cyber security. An example application would be detecting outliers in network traffic.
