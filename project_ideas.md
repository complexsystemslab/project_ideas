I work in explainable AI (xAI) and unconventional approaches to AI. I work at the intersection of complex systems and xAI: I take inspiration from complex systems to suggest new approaches to AI, and use AI to analyze complex systems.


## Projects 

### Project idea 1 (Explainable AI)

* Contemporary approaches towards explainable AI are model-centric. We will use data-centric approaches to explain the complex interplay between data and models. This will build on and extend published work [1]. This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience. 
 
 There are many ways in which the work presented in [1] can be extended (either new methods or new application areas). Please get in touch to discuss. 
 
 
### Project idea 1B

 Another project idea is to apply explainable AI approaches to genomic data. This will be a machine learning and bioinformatics project.
 
 Tge student will develop explainable AI approaches for interpreting clusters in single-cell gene expression data.

  This work is part of the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery which aims to democratize access to AI tools and apply AI to problems from diverse disciplines. The student will be part of a growing community of inter-disciplinary AI researchers at the University of Cambridge. 


### Project idea 2

* For high stakes decisions we need simple and explainable/interpretable models. This need is acute in the case of healthcare and social sciences like recidivism prediction [2]. In this project, we will build simple interpretable models that are surrogates for deep learning models. 

  The student will look at publicly available data and synthetic data to generate surrogate models that are transparent and interpretable. The process of creating these surrogate interpretable models will be automated. This can also be partially based on published work [1]. 

 The surrogate models can be decision trees (like CART) trained on the input and output of a deep learning model [1].   This can use R packages like party, rpart, partykit or other packages. 
 This will lead to tools that automated the creation of surrogate interpretable models based on deep learning models in healthcare. 

  This project will be ideal for a student with interest in machine learning and who has coding experience.

### Project idea 3

Tailor machine learning model explanations based on audience (e.g. patients, clinicians, farmers, etc.). Generate natural language explanations from machine learning model and tailor these natural language expplnanations based on unique background of listener.

 ### Project idea 4
 
 * Build a computational model of analogy making and apply it to biomedical and genomic data.
 
 For other project ideas related to explainable AI see the following page:
 
 https://github.com/neelsoumya/special_topics_unconventional_AI/
 
 Broadly this will use concepts like analogies and stories to create new explainable AI methods.
 
 See for example 
 
 https://github.com/Tijl/ANASIME
 
 https://github.com/crazydonkey200/SMEPy

 https://github.com/fargonauts/copycat
 
 
 ### Project idea 5
 
 Build a machine learning algorithm or domain specific language to solve the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge
 
   https://github.com/fchollet/ARC

 Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus Challenge

   https://blog.jovian.ai/finishing-2nd-in-kaggles-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge-24e59c07b50a

   https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle

 Domain specific languages may be required (as suggested by Chollet) like genetic algorithms and cellular automata.
 
 <!--
 This will also involve extensions of the DreamCoder paper.
 
 DreamCoder: Growing generalizable, interpretable knowledge with wake-sleep Bayesian program learning
 
   https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381
 --> 


 <!--Please note this is a very challenging project.-->
 
 

### Project idea 6 (Automated Scientific Discovery)
  
This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws (like Kepler's Law) and invariants (like Boyle's Law) from data.  

This may involve building a model or Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of infection dynamics (like a SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5]. This would apply a probabilistic programming model to infection data from different sources.  

Other models include phsyics simulators like pymunk:

http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/examples.html#planet-py

You would simulate physics based simulations (like pymunk) or other models (like the SIR model above) and develop a machine learning approach to automatically generate insights from this model.

This would be an explainable AI model for a complex model of a physical system.

The project would involve building a model that would generate insights from these complex systems (an artificial model of human creativity).



### Project idea 6B
  
This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws (like Kepler's Law) and invariants (like Boyle's Law) from data.  This will enable us to automatically discover conservation laws from data.

One can build a model or Bayesian model and/or probabilistic programming model of a complex systems model like infection dynamics (SIR model) or an intra-cellular regulatory network [5]. 

This would involve building a qualitative process model for a physical system.   

This would be an explainable AI model for a complex model of a physical system.

The project would involve building a model that would generate insights from these complex systems (an artificial model of human creativity).


### Project idea 6C

This is a project on automatically discovering scientific laws or mathematical equations from data.    

This would involve extending the Ramanujan machine by applying it to other data or other dynamical systems or using another machine learning approach.

https://github.com/RamanujanMachine/RamanujanMachine

Other ideas including extending AI Feynman 2.0 

https://github.com/SJ001/AI-Feynman

or BACON.3

https://github.com/jantzen/BACON

One can also apply symbolic regression approaches like PySR (python) or gramEvol (R).

<!-- one can also apply Bayesian symbolic regression. This can be applied to discover trigonometric identities. This would be a joint project with Challenger Mishra -->

Other approaches include Bayesian symbolic regression 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08892

https://github.com/ying531/MCMC-SymReg


or seq2seq approaches to symbolic regression

https://openreview.net/pdf?id=W7jCKuyPn1

https://github.com/SymposiumOrganization/NeuralSymbolicRegressionThatScales

This would be an artificial model of human creativity.

Other ideas include discovering ordinary differential equations from data

https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02830#


### Project idea 7 (Collective intelligence in AI)

Dynamics of collective learning in artificial neural networks, Hopfield networks, self organizing maps and neural gas.
 
 
### Project idea 7B
 
The role of noise in collective artifical intelligence in building behaviour (altruism, co-operation, competition) and structures (structures to capture prey). This will use the multi-agent platform MAgent

https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent

We can also use the EvoJax framework

https://github.com/google/evojax/blob/main/examples/notebooks/EncirclingAgents.ipynb

We can also extend MAgent using dream mechanisms in World Models

https://worldmodels.github.io/

https://smartlabai.medium.com/world-models-a-reinforcement-learning-story-cdcc86093c5



### Project idea 8 (Explainable neural cellular automata)

Extending the neural cellular automata

https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/#experiment-2

and make it more interpretable and explainable.

For example, you can apply it to data from the Game of Life and infer the rules.

https://github.com/lantunes/netomaton/blob/master/demos/game_of_life/README.md

https://github.com/tomgrek/gameoflife

We can also apply it to biological data from cell biology.
<!-- morphology or wave propagation in the Rho GTPase system -->
<!--This would be similar to wave propagation in B-Z systems. We can also apply it to data from the B-Z system. -->

<!-- we can also apply it to data from computational fluid dynamics -->


### Project idea 9

* Other project ideas are generating synthetic data from private datasets like data from electronic healthcare records data [3], other explanatory artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques, privacy preserving machine learning [4], documenting data and models, detecting concept drift, etc. 

 Project ideas can be developed according to student interests.

## Bigger Picture

The main objective is to develop a suite of techniques inspired by classical AI to inform explainable AI.
This project is part of a wider effort of unconventional approaches to AI.
